;;; Commentary:

;; ruby-tools is a minor mode for Emacs that can be used with
;; ruby-mode. It includes various handy functions that will improve
;; your productivity.
;;
;; To use ruby-tools-mode, make sure that this file is in Emacs load-path:
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/directory/or/file")
;;
;; Then require ruby-tools:
;;   (require 'ruby-tools)
;;
;; ruby-tools-mode is automatically started in ruby-mode.
